# Damian Lillard PPG by Day of the Week

This repo contains a quick analysis of Damian Lillard, Point-Guard for the Portland Trail Blazers. 

As an incredibly basic intro to my personal projects, I thought it would be interesting to see if Damian Lillard was any more efficient during a particular day of the week. Surprise, he's incredibly efficient regardless of the day.
